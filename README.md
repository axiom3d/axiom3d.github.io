## Contributing

Any contributions are appreciated, no matter how big or small. The Axiom 3D site consists of several different sections and each one is described below.

Please read the [Contributing guide](contributing.md) for more details on how to contribute to the project.

## Documentation

The basic documentation pages can be found under `./input/docs`. The directory structure mirrors what's on the site. Most pages are written in Markdown. To add a new page, just add a new file.

## Blog

The Axiom 3D site contains a blog where important announcements and other information is posted. The blog posts can be found under `./input/blog`. As with documentation pages, blog posts are written in Markdown. The file name for each blog post contains it's published date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`.

## Building

The site is built using [Cake](http://cakebuild.net). There are a number of different targets depending on what you're working on and how complete you want the generated site to be.

You will also need [Powershell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases) installed and available on the path for whatever your OS of choice is.

`.\build.ps1 -target Build` will run a complete build.

`.\build.ps1 -target Preview` will run a build and launch a preview server to look at the generated site from a local web browser. The URL of the generated preview site is `http://localhost:5080/`.
